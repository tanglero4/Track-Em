## Description
Track`Em is a back-end program built for users to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in their company. Users will be able to add, update and organize their database. The information that is added to this program is displayed in an easy to read table. This project was made using Javascript, DBeaver, Mysql, Inquirer, and Express. Building this back-end project I learned how to use DBeaver, Mysql, Inquirer, and Express.
